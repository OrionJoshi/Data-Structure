What is Stack??

    Stack is an abstract data type (ADT) and very useful in programming.
    In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements.
    Majorly all the operations are done at only one end of the stack which is top of the stack.
    The order in which elements in stack are stored is with LIFO (Last-in-First-Out) manner.
    Means the element inserted last will be removed first.
Operation on Stack

    Initialize a topIndex = -1;

    For push() operation- increment topIndex by 1 and add element at this index in array. Time- O(1)
    For pop() operation- remove element from the topIndex, decrement topIndex by. Time- O(1)
    For peek() operation- return the element from the topIndex. Time- O(1)
    For isEmpty() operation- check if topIndex<0 then return true else false. Time- O(1)
    For getSize() operation- return the topindex+1. Time- O(1)
